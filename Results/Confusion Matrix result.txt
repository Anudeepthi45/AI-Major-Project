--> Each confusion matrix shows how well models classify:
      >> True Positives (TP): correctly predicted heart disease
      >> True Negatives (TN): correctly predicted no heart disease
      >> False Positives (FP): predicted disease but patient is healthy
      >> False Negatives (FN): predicted healthy but patient has disease
--> Random Forest confusion matrix shows the highest TP and TN values, indicating superior performance.
