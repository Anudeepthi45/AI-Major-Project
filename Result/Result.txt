_> This is performance of all four machine-learning models used for Heart Disease Prediction. 
-> The evaluation is based on Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and visual analysis through Confusion Matrix and ROC-AUC curves.
== Model Performance Summary ==
        Model	- Accuracy
          Logistic Regression  - 0.7869
          Decision Tree	       - 0.7049
          Random Forest	       - 0.8197
          Neural Network (MLP) - 0.7869
    -> Random Forest achieved the best accuracy: 81.96%

== Detailed Metrics ==
>> Logistic Regression
    Accuracy: 0.7868
    Precision: 0.7631
    Recall: 0.8787
    F1-Score: 0.8169
    ROC-AUC: 0.7786
Interpretation:
* The model is good at identifying patients with heart disease (high recall). Balanced performance but slightly lower accuracy than Random Forest.

>> Decision Tree
    Accuracy: 0.7049
    Precision: 0.7027
    Recall: 0.7878
    F1-Score: 0.7428
    ROC-AUC: 0.6975
Interpretation:
* Decision Tree tends to overfit and gives the lowest accuracy and AUC among all models.

>> Random Forest
    Accuracy: 0.8196
    Precision: 0.7619
    Recall: 0.9696
    F1-Score: 0.8533
    ROC-AUC: 0.8062
Interpretation:
* Random Forest performs the best, capturing almost all positive heart disease cases (very high recall). Shows strong generalization.

>> Neural Network (MLPClassifier)
    Accuracy: 0.7868
    Precision: 0.7941
    Recall: 0.8181
    F1-Score: 0.8059
    ROC-AUC: 0.7840
Interpretation:
* Neural Network gives stable performance, similar to Logistic Regression.

== Final Conclusion ==
  -> Among all models, Random Forest provides the best performance for heart disease prediction with the highest accuracy, recall, and ROC-AUC score. 
  -> Logistic Regression and Neural Network also achieve strong and consistent performance. 
  -> Decision Tree performs the worst due to overfitting.
